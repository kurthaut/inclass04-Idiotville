###Summary
This docment serves to explore the how entertainment has evolved over time by looking at three forms of entertainment throughout history. 
We will explore three forms of entertainment, that may at first seems unrelated, however, after reading this file, it is our hope that you will see the similiarities and how we have come up with what we currently watch as entertainment! 
We start off in the age of the Ancient Greeks and see how they competed in the olympics. We then fast forward to the height of the Roman Empire where the Colosseum was used to entertain the masses. We then conclude with the modern day Super Bowl and look at how it is really a combination of both of those events.

###Greek Olympics
The ancient Olympic Games were originally a festival, or celebration of and for Zeus; later, events such as a footrace, a javelin contest, and wrestling matches were added. The Olympic Games were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of ancient Greece.
